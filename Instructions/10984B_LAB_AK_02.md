    ```
    .\CreateProblemUsers.ps1
    ```

    > **Note:** Wait until the script has completed before proceeding to the next step.

12. This script will make following changes in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS):

  - Klemen Sic. Adds the at sign \(@\) to the beginning of **"adatum"** for the **UserPrincipalName** attribute.
  - Lara Raisic. Replaces the existing string with **"lara@adatum.com"** for the **EmailAddress** attribute.

1. Switch back to the IdFix tool.
1. On the toolbar, select **Query**.
1. In the **UPDATE** column, select the **Logan Boyle** error, replace the string with **logan@adatum.com**, and then in the **ACTION** column, select **EDIT**.
1. In the **UPDATE** column, select the **Maj Hojski** error, replace the string with **maj@adatum.com**, and then in the **ACTION** column, select **EDIT**.
1. On the toolbar, select **Apply**.
1. In the **Apply Pending** box, select **Yes**.
1. On the toolbar, select **Query**, and then verify that errors were corrected.

> **Note:** Where format and duplicate errors for distinguished names exist, the **UPDATE** column either contains the same string as the **VALUE** column or is blank. In either case, this means that IdFix cannot suggest a remediation for the error. You can either fix these errors outside IdFix or manually remediate them within IdFix. You can also export the results and use Windows PowerShell to remediate a large number of errors.
