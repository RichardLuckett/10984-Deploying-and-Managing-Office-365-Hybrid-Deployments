# Lab Answer Key:  Module 3: Exchange Server hybrid deployment planning
# Lab: Planning and designing the integration between Exchange Online and Exchange Server 2016
  
## Exercise 1: Designing an Exchange hybrid deployment
  
#### Task 1: Read and analyze the scenario requirements
  
- Read the exercise scenario. Analyze the requirements from an integration perspective. Identify the configurations that are necessary to satisfy the requirements.


#### Task 2: Design a solution
  
  **Question**: What components do you need to install and configure to satisfy the requirements? 

  **Answer**: You need the following components:

  - The Azure AD Connect already is deployed, but you must reconfigure it for an Exchange Hybrid deployment.
  - You must use Password Synchronization as your password-management solution because it requires the least amount of administrative effort.
  - You must deploy an Edge Transport Server to act as a relay between the on-premises Exchange Servers and EOP, and to prevent the internal servers from communicating directly with the internet.
  - The Hybrid Configuration wizard is required to configure a hybrid deployment that satisfies the remaining requirements.

  **Question**: What are the licensing requirements for Exchange Online? 

  **Answer**: Adatum must acquire 3,500 Enterprise subscriptions to support 50 percent of the mailboxes within the next six months.

  **Question**: What existing Exchange Servers can you use for Hybrid transport and Autodiscover? 

  **Answer**: You can use **NYC-DAG1**, **LON-DAG1**, and **ATL-EX1** for Client Access services and Autodiscover. Based on the requirements, you can't use any of the current servers for message transport to EOP. You must deploy at least one Edge Transport Server because hybrid transport does not support the existing non-Microsoft SMTP relay devices.

  **Question**: What other areas do you need to consider if you want to run the Hybrid Configuration wizard successfully? 

  **Answer**: You need to consider the following items:

  - You must publish the at least one Client Access Server to a reverse proxy to resolve AutoDiscover requests. You can use the Layer 7 network load balancer as a reverse proxy.
  - You need to install a publicly trusted digital certificate to make AutoDiscover and Microsoft Exchange Server Federated Sharing work with Exchange Online.

  **Question**: What would be different if Adatum were running only Exchange Server 2010 and not Exchange Server 2013 on-premises? 

  **Answer**: If Adatum were running Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 instead of Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, you would need to add an Exchange Server 2016 server to the Exchange Server organization. You also must consider all other requirements in the previous answer.

  **Question**: What Hybrid Transport option should you implement? 

  **Answer**: Based on the non-Microsoft solution requirements for regulatory compliance, you should configure centralized mail transport so that the on-premises servers scan outbound mail for all online users.


> **Result**: After completing this exercise, you will have successfully read and analyzed the scenario requirements and designed a solution.


## Exercise 2: Discussing a solution and reviewing the Exchange Online setup
  
#### Task 1: Discuss your solution with the class
  
- Present your proposed solution to the class. Discuss alternative solutions with other students and with the instructor.


#### Task 2: Reviewing an Exchange Online configuration in an Office 365 tenant
  

1. Switch to **LON-CL1**.
2. Sign in as **Adatum\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
3. From the task bar, open Microsoft Edge.
4. In the Microsoft Edge address bar, enter **portal.office.com**, and then press Enter.
5. When prompted for an account, enter the Office 365 administrator username that you created in the Module 1 lab, such as **beth@adatumyyxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com**.

    >**Note:** If Stay signed in? page appears click **No**.

6. Enter the password of your Office 365 administrator account, and then select **Sign in**.
7. To open the Microsoft 365 admin center, select the **Admin** app.

    > **Note:** If you have trouble seeing the information in the portal, change the zoom settings for Edge to 75 percent.

8. In the left navigation menu, click **Show all** select **Health**, and then select **Service Health**.
9. In the **Service health** window, confirm that the Exchange Online service status is **Service is healthy**.
10. In the left navigation menu, select **Settings**, and then select **Domains**.
11. On the **Domains** page, review the list of domain names. You should see at least one domain by default with the domain name_adatumyyxxxxx_.onmicrosoft.com. If a custom domain was added in an earlier lab, you will also see that domain in the list. For example, you might see **adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com** where yyxxxxx.hostdomain.com is the custom domain provided to you.
12. Select the **_adatumyyxxxxx_.onmicrosoft.com** domain. Note that there are no DNS records listed under the DNS settings section of the page.
13. To return to the **Domains** page, select **Close**.
14. In the **Domain name** list, select the custom domain that you added in Module 1 Lab A, such as **adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**, where yyxxxxx is your unique lab number. Note the numerous DNS records listed under **Required DNS settings** on the custom domain's property page.
15. On the **domain property** page, locate and expand the **Exchange Online** section.
16. Review the records listed. You should see at least three record types: MX, TXT, and CNAME. Note that the Points to address or value for all three records are in the outlook.com namespace that Microsoft manages.

    > **Note:** In a hybrid deployment, you do not want to create the canonical name (CNAME) record that points to Exchange Online for client Autodiscover until all users have been moved to Exchange Online. However, you must add the MX record and/or TXT SPF record based on the hybrid transport routing decisions that you make.

17. To return to the **Domains** page, select **Close**.
18. In the left navigation menu, select **Admin centers**, and then to open the Exchange admin center, select **Exchange**.
    > **Note:** Select **Classic Exchange admin center** to align with the steps in this lab.
19. In the left navigation menu, select **Permissions**.
20. In the **admin roles** list, double-click **Organization Management**.
21. On the **Organization Management** page, scroll down to the **Members** section. Note that by default only the **Company Administrator** has the Organization Management role.
22. To return to the **admin roles** list, select **Cancel**.
23. Double-click the **Compliance Management** admin role.
24. Are there any default members of this group? 
25. To return to the admin roles list, select **Cancel**.

    > **Note:** The answer is no by default. In fact, in Exchange Online, no other admin roles have members by default. You must add administrators before they can perform their expected tasks in Exchange Online, even if they were members of the same admin roles on-premises.

26. In the left navigation menu, select **organization**.
27. Review the default settings in the **sharing** tab. 

    > **Note** There is no organization relationship set up. However, there is a Default Sharing Policy. By running the Hybrid Configuration wizard, you can create an organization relationship so that individual users do not have to manage sharing free/busy information with other users cross-premises.

28. In the left navigation menu, select **mail flow**.
29. On the **mail flow** page, select the **accepted domains** tab. Note the **Accepted Domain** and **Domain type** fields for each domain in the list. These domain types are added automatically when you add a custom domain to your Office 365 tenant.
30. Double-click the custom domain in the list, such as **adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**.
31. Point the mouse to the **Accept mail for all subdomains** option to view the description. This option is helpful if your organization uses multiple email addresses based on subdomains and you don't want to provision each one of them as a custom domain. Examples are **@emea.adatum.com**, **@na.adatum.com**, and **@apac.adatum.com**.

    > **Note:** You would use the Internal Relay type if an organization subscribes to EOP only to protect their on-premises mail system.

32. To discard changes and return to **mail flow** page, select **Cancel**.
33. On the **mail flow** page, select the **connectors** tab. Note that there are no connectors by default.
34. Select **New** (plus icon), and then in the **From** field, select the **down arrow**.
35. From the list, select **Your organization's email server**.
36. From the **To** field drop-down list, select **Office 365**. Review the description of this mail flow scenario.
37. Change the **From** field to **Office 365**.
38. Change the **To** field to **Your organization's email server**. Review the description of this scenario.
39. To return to **mail flow** page, select **Cancel**.

    > **Note:** By running the Hybrid Configuration wizard, you can create the connectors in Exchange Online as well as the connectors for the on-premises Exchange Servers.

40. In the left navigation pane, select **hybrid**. Note that you can access the Hybrid Configuration wizard web app here in Office 365. The same option is available in Exchange Server 2016 or newer on-premises.
41. Close Microsoft Edge.
42. Select **Close all**.
