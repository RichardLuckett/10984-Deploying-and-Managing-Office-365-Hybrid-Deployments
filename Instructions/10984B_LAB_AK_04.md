# Lab Answer Key:  Module 4: Exchange Server hybrid deployment
# Lab: Implement the Exchange Server hybrid deployment
  
## Exercise 1: Using the Hybrid Configuration Wizard
  
#### Task 1: Verify public accessibility
  

1. On **LON-WAP1**, already signed in as **LON-WAP1\Administrator**, open Internet Explorer, navigate to **bing.com**, type **whatismyipaddress.com** in the **Search** box, and then press Enter.
2. If an Internet Explorer dialog box open, Click **Yes**.
3. Confirm this is the same Public IP address you have used in prior labs. Document the public IP address displayed for the **LON-WAP1** server. You will need this IP address later.
4. Close the **Internet Explorer** window.
5. On **LON-CL1**, sign in as **Adatum\Beth** with the password **Pa55w.rd**, from the taskbar, open Microsoft Edge, and then navigate to [https://aka.ms/AA2p30o](https://aka.ms/AA2p30o).

    >**Note:** if you are signed in as a different user from a previous lab, first sign out, select the option to sign in as **Other user** and then sign in as **Adatum\Beth**.

6. In the **Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer** window, select the **Exchange server** tab, select **Synchronization, Notification, Availability, and Automatic Replies**. Select **Next**.
7. In the **Synchronization, Notification, Availability, and Automatic Replies** window, specify the following:

  - Email address: **abbi@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**
  - Domain\User Name (or UPN): **abbi@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**
  - Password: **Moc10984B**
  - Confirm Password: **Moc10984B**
  - Select the **I understand that I must use the credentials of a working account from my Exchange domain to be able to test connectivity to it remotely. I also acknowledge that I am responsible for the management and security of this account** check box.

    >**Note:** If you receive the error **"Verifying the challenge failed. Please refresh the page and try again."** in the next step, this means the captcha feature is not currently working. This is a know issue that happens periodically with this site. If the issue does not resolve within 5 minutes you should skip to step 20 and continue with the lab. 

8. Type the verification characters, select **Verify**, and then select **Perform Test**.

    > **Note:** You should receive a "Connectivity Test Successful with Warnings" message. This indicates that on-premises Exchange Web Services is accessible. If you do receive an error, verify that DNS records were created on LON-DC1 using your assigned custom domain name.

9. Select **Start Over** to go back to the **Exchange Server** tab.
10. In the **Microsoft Office Outlook Connectivity Tests** section, select **Outlook Autodiscover**, and then select **Next**.
11. In the **Outlook Autodiscover** window, specify the following:

  - Email address: **abbi@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**
  - Domain\User Name (or UPN): **abbi@Adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**
  - Password: **Moc10984B**
  - Confirm Password: **Moc10984B**
  - Select the **I understand that I must use the credentials of a working account from my Exchange domain to be able to test connectivity to it remotely. I also acknowledge that I am responsible for the management and security of this account** check box.

12. If necessary, type the verification characters, select **Verify**, and then select **Perform Test**.
13. In the **Test Details** section, select **Expand All**, locate the **Attempting to resolve the host name adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com in DNS** test step, and then compare the IP addresses returned in this test step to the one you documented in step 2. If it matches one of the addresses, you have connected to your on-premises server by using Outlook Anywhere.

    > **Note:** You should receive a "Connectivity Test Successful with Warnings" message. Selecting the **Ignore Trust for SSL** check box would allow this test to succeed even if your certificate is not trusted.

14. Click on **Exchange Server** in the navigation pane.
15. Select **Inbound SMTP EMail**, and then select **Next**.
16. In the **Inbound SMTP EMail** window, type the following email address: **abbi@adatumyyxxxxx.hostdomain.com**.
17. If necessary, type the verification characters, and then select **Verify**. Select **Perform Test**.

    > **Note:** You should receive a "Connectivity Test Successful" message.

    > Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) uses opportunistic Transport Layer Security (TLS) by default. Even if the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer does not trust the certificate, the test message will succeed.

18. In the **Test Details** window, select **Expand All**, scroll to the last test performed, and then verify that the following message appears: "The Open Relay test passed. This MX isn't an open relay." 
19. Exit the Remote Connectivity Analyzer by closing Microsoft Edge.
20. On **LON-EX1**, already signed in as **Adatum\Administrator**, click **Start** and expand Microsoft Exchange Server 2019 and select Exchange Management Shell.
21. In the **Exchange Management Shell** window, run the following command, and then press Enter:

    ```
    Get-ExchangeCertificate | Where-Object {$_.Subject -match "^CN=\*"} | Format-List
    ```

22. In the **Exchange Management Shell** window, confirm the certificate that on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server uses by reviewing the results for the following attributes:

  - IsSelfSigned: **False**
  - NotAfter: _date not expired_
  - Status: **Valid**
  - Services: **SMTP**

    > **Note:** It is a good idea to document the thumbprint for the certificate that Exchange Server used. Event logs typically reference a certificate thumbprint, rather than the subject or friendly name, in warnings and error messages. This is also helpful when multiple certificates with the same subject name exist.
    > In your production environments, you also want to make sure that **Issuer** is trusted third party public certificate authority so Microsoft Exchange Online can trust the certificate.

23. Leave the **Exchange Management Shell** window open.


#### Task 2: Use the Exchange admin center to verify on-premises deployment
  

1. On **LON-CL1**, already signed in as **Adatum\Beth**, open Microsoft Edge, and then navigate to **https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home**. Sign in as **beth@adatumyyxxxx.onmicrosoft.com** with the password you created in the lab in Module 1, "Introduction to Office 365 administration and licensing. "

6. To return to the **admin roles** list, select **Cancel**.
7. Double-click the **Compliance Management** admin role.
 
    > **Note:** By default, this group has no members. If your production environment lists any administrators, document them so you can grant them the equivalent role in Exchange Online.

8. To return to admin roles list, click **Cancel**.
9. In the navigation pane on the left side, select **organization**.
10. On the **sharing** tab, review the default settings. Note that no organization relationship is set up. When you run the **Hybrid Configuration Wizard**, it creates an organization relationship so that individual users do not have to manage sharing free/busy information with other users cross-premises.
11. On the navigation menu on the left side, select **mail flow**.
12. On the **mail flow** page, select the **accepted domains** tab. Note the **Accepted Domain** and **Domain type** fields for each domain in the list.

  - **Default frontend LON-EX1 - FrontendTransport**
  - **Outbound Proxy Frontend LON-EX1 - Frontend Transport**
  - **Client Proxy LON-EX1 - HubTransport**
  - **Default LON-EX1 -HubTransport**

14. On the **mail flow** page, select the **send connectors** tab. Note that one connector exists. However, no Send connectors exist by default when Exchange Server is deployed.

    > **Note:** By running the **Hybrid Configuration Wizard**, you will create specific connectors in Exchange Online and on-premises for the hybrid environment.

15. On the navigation menu on the left side, notice there is no **unified messaging** option. Exchange Server 2019 and newer no longer include this service.
16. In the navigation pane on the left side, select **servers**. Document the version of the on-premises server.
17. In Internet Explorer, open a new tab, navigate to [https://aka.ms/AA216yr](https://aka.ms/AA216yr), and then locate the product and cumulative update or rollup that matches the build number displayed in the Exchange admin center.

    > **Note:** Remember that the version of Exchange Server you are running impacts the version of the **Hybrid Configuration Wizard** you can use and the features that your hybrid deployment makes available.

18. Switch to the **servers - Microsoft Exchange** tab.
19. In the navigation pane on the left side, select **hybrid**. Note that you can access the **Hybrid Configuration Wizard** web app here in Exchange Server on-premises. The same option is available in Microsoft Office 365.
